Data Cleaning Library
=====================

The main goal of this project is to implement a framework that gives users access to a wide variety of data cleaning and data curation tools (i.e. a data cleaning library). The framework allows users to combine tools from the library into data cleaning workflows. The main programming language used is Python.

The framework is flexible and extensible to allow easy integration of tools that implement data cleaning functionality. We therefore define a set of data cleaning primitives and APIâ€™s to wrap existing data analytics and data transformation programs and integrate them into the library.

Another important aspect for the framework is to support data cleaning workflows that are interactive and explorative.
